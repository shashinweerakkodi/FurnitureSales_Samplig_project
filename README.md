# 🪑 Furniture Sales Data Analysis - IS3001 Group Project

This project was completed as part of the IS3001: Sampling Techniques course at the University of Colombo, Faculty of Science. Our objective was to explore and compare different sampling methods for analyzing a real-world dataset of furniture sales.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Furniture Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajagrawal7089/furniture-sales-data)
- **Observations:** 2500
- **Target Variable:** Price
- **Auxiliary Variable:** Cost

## 🧪 Statistical Techniques Applied
- Simple Random Sampling (SRS)
- Stratified Sampling (based on `category`)
- Two-Stage Cluster Sampling (based on `color`)
- Regression Estimation
- Ratio Estimation

## 📌 Key Findings
- Strong positive linear relationship between Price and Cost (r ≈ 0.93)
- Regression Estimation provided the most precise estimates across all sampling designs
- Two-stage cluster sampling had the lowest standard errors
